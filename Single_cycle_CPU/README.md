# MIPS_Pipelined-CPU

This is NCKU Computer Architecture and IC design LAB course project. 

The project is Single cycle CPU.

I have written a insertion sort assembly code, and test in my Single cycle CPU.
I have modified some part of testbench, because "memory needs 8 bits width in each address".

Implenment 23 instrucetion, contain :
